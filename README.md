# Inverted Index Project

## Overview

This project involves building an inverted index from a set of HTML files. The inverted index is a map that associates tokens (words) with postings, where each posting contains information about the token's occurrence in a document. This project will require you to design a posting structure, calculate term frequency (TF), and generate basic analytics about your index.

## Deliverables

1. **Code**: Submit your complete code that implements the inverted index.
2. **Report (PDF)**: Submit a PDF report with the following analytics:
   - The number of indexed documents.
   - The number of unique tokens.
   - The total size (in KB) of the index on disk.

**Note**: The developer option does not require an optimized index at this point, but building one may save you time later.

## Design Tips

- **Posting Structure**: The posting should contain:
  - The document ID or name where the token was found.
  - The term frequency (TF) for the token in that document.
  - (Optional) Other information you deem useful for your index.

- **Coding Approach**: 
  - Break down the code into scripts or classes that perform related functions.
  - This modular approach will help you track your progress and debug more efficiently.
  - Use GitHub to collaborate with teammates, but ensure the project is set to private.

## Submission Details

- **Report**: Ensure your report includes the required analytics and is submitted on time.
- **GitHub Repository**: Submit the link to your private GitHub repository.
- **Late Submission**: No late submissions will be accepted for this milestone.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Timeliness**: Was your report submitted on time?
2. **Accuracy**: Are the numbers reported in the analytics plausible?

**Important**: You can only change teams between milestones of Assignment 3 if there are strong reasons. If you need to change teams, please email the teaching team explaining the reason, and they will assess your situation.
